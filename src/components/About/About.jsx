        The Symbiotic Intelligence Research Group (SIRG) aims towards
        transdisciplinary research by augmenting human intelligence with the
        capabilities of intelligent information systems. The acronym “SIRG” is
        pronounced as “Surge”, conveying dynamism and leap towards innovation
        and progress. Symbiotic intelligence is considered the future of
        Artificial Intelligence. The group focuses on performing applied
        research using cooperation, coordination and communication techniques to
        solve problems for autonomous systems. Our mission is to design,
        develop, and validate solutions through the deployment of connected and
        cooperative intelligence by exploring the potential of intelligent
        communication systems.
