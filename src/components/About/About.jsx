          The Symbiotic Intelligence Research Group (SIRG) aims towards
          transdisciplinary research by augmenting human intelligence with the
          capabilities of intelligent information systems. The acronym “SIRG” is
          pronounced as “Surge”, conveying dynamism and leap towards innovation
          and progress. Symbiotic intelligence is considered the future of
          Artificial Intelligence. The group focuses on performing applied
          research using cooperation, coordination and communication techniques
          to solve problems for autonomous systems. Our mission is to design,
          develop, and validate solutions through the deployment of connected
          and cooperative intelligence by exploring the potential of intelligent
          communication systems.
